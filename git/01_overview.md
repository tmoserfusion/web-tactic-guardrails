# Git

## Workflow
Generally, we use the [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow).

> The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the `master` branch. This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the `master` branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.

See Atlassian's [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow) documentation for more details.
