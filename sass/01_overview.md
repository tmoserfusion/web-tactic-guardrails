# Sass
Sass should generally follow [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es). I've outlined general guidelines and exceptions here. See the [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es) for more details.

## Syntax and formatting
Roughly, we want:
- tabs, not spaces;
- ideally, 80-characters wide lines;
- properly written multi-line CSS rules;
- meaningful use of whitespace.

```
// Yep
.foo {
	display: block;
	overflow: hidden;
	padding: 0 1em;
}

// Nope
.foo {
		display: block; overflow: hidden;

		padding: 0 1em;
}
```

## CSS Ruleset
At this point, this is mostly revising what everybody knows, but here is how a CSS ruleset should be written (at least, according to most guidelines, including CSS Guidelines):

- related selectors on the same line; unrelated selectors on new lines;
- the opening brace ({) spaced from the last selector by a single space;
- each declaration on its own new line;
- a space after the colon (:);
- a trailing semi-colon (;) at the end of all declarations;
- the closing brace (}) on its own new line;
- a new line after the closing brace }.

Illustration:
```
// Yep
.foo, .foo-bar,
.baz {
	display: block;
	overflow: hidden;
	margin: 0 auto;
}

// Nope
.foo,
.foo-bar, .baz {
		display: block;
		overflow: hidden;
		margin: 0 auto }
```

Adding to those CSS-related guidelines, we want to pay attention to:

- local variables being declared before any declarations, then spaced from declarations by a new line;
- mixin calls with no @content coming before any declaration;
- nested selectors always coming after a new line;
- mixin calls with @content coming after any nested selector;
- no new line before a closing brace (}).

Illustration:
```
.foo, .foo-bar,
.baz {
	$length: 42em;

	@include ellipsis;
	@include size($length);
	display: block;
	overflow: hidden;
	margin: 0 auto;

	&:hover {
		color: red;
	}

	@include respond-to('small') {
		overflow: visible;
	}
}
```

## Declaration Sorting
Concretely, there are two factions here:

- sticking to the alphabetical order;
- ordering declarations by type (position, display, colors, font, miscellaneousâ€¦).

Order declarations based on type, not alphabetically. Alphabetal ordering separates properties that are logically linked (height and width, margins and padding, etc...)

Here's an example of ordering by type:
```
.selector {
	/* Display & Positioning */
	display: block;
	float: none;
	clear: none;
	position: absolute;
	z-index: 10;
	top: 0;
	right: 0;
	opacity: 1;

	/* Box model should be ordered OUTSIDE-IN. */
	/* So first margin, then border, then padding, and finally dimensions */
	box-sizing: border-box;
	margin: 10px;
	border: 10px solid #333;
	padding: 10px;
	width: 100px;
	height: 100px;
	overflow: hidden;
	background: #000;

	/* Color & Text */
	color: #fff;
	font-family: sans-serif;
	font-size: 16px;
	line-height: 1.4;
	text-align: right;

	/* Other */
	cursor: pointer;
}
```

## Selector Nesting
Avoid selector nesting as much as possible. The [@at-root](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#at-root) directive can be used to reduce nesting while still keeping rules in logical order.
