# Images
Don't use unnecessarry images.

Handle design elements with CSS. Many icons can be generated with unicode characters. Menu hamburger icons can be created with pseudo elements and have the advantage of being animatable. Arrows and carets can be created with borders.

If you have to use an image, use an SVG when possible. Optimize your SVGs in your build process or by using [SVG OMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)

If you have to use an image and it can't be SVG, optimize it in your build process, manually with command line tools or with an app like [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) for Mac or [something similar for Windows](https://imageoptim.com/versions.html#windows).
