# CSS
Use Sass (SCSS) syntax. See the [Sass section](sass/01_overview.md) for details on Sass guardrails.

Don't use inline styles. They are difficult to maintain and make responsive design difficult.

CSS files should be linted with [CSSLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csslint) as an integrated part of the site build process. See the CSSLint configuration file for recommended settings.
