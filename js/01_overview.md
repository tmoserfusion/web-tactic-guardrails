# JS

## Syntax and formatting
Roughly, we want:
- tabs, not spaces;
- consistent indentation
- ideally, 80-characters wide lines;
- meaningful use of whitespace;
- no commented-out code.

## Linting
CSS files should be linted with [JSHint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jshint) as an integrated part of the site build process. See the JSHint configuration file for recommended settings. *Add config file

## Style

**Should we be using ES6 and ESLint? Babel for pre-processor? Or should we just stick with ES5 for now?**
